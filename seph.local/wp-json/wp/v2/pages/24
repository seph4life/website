Some of the first life insurance policies through cryptocurrency have started to be offered (2). However there&#8217;s very few organizations working with web3 and life insurance. The returns for buying or providing loans for life insurance should be comparable to other major web3 loan protocols (around 8%) (3). Around a quarter of life insurance policies are purchased with the intention to donate them to a charity. Currently someone donated to a Canadian conservation organization a USD $1 million life insurance policy that they&#8217;d like to take a loan against to get further funding for their conservation efforts. In this brief, we present the idea of a secondary market for life insurance- either selling outright or using them as collateral for a loan facilitated by smart contracts.<\/p>\n<h1>Cash for Life Insurance\u00a0<\/h1>\n<p>A person that has life insurance (Insured) wants to get cash for it.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Option A: Get the Surrender Value<\/p>\n<p>Option B: Get above the Surrender Value but below the Death Benefit by selling to an interested party(ies)<\/p>\n<p>Option C: Borrow against life insurance<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If Option B is chosen<\/p>\n<p>Insured puts life insurance on the market<\/p>\n<p>Funders are made aware of opportunity\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Funders provide capital above the surrender value\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Premium remaining to be paid is calculated based on insured&#8217;s age minus top life expectancy times yearly premium amount<\/p>\n<p>Once capital is provided above the surrender value the cash is transferred to insured minus the premium remaining to be paid, the life insurance is transferred to the holder as well as the value of premium remaining to be paid\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Holder has to continue paying premium until insured is proven dead<\/p>\n<p>Once dead the death benefit is paid out<\/p>\n<p>Holder sends death benefit to funders proportional to their share of capital provided.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Option C\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Insured puts life insurance on the market<\/p>\n<p>Funders are made aware of opportunity\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Funders provide capital above the surrender value\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Once capital is provided above the surrender value the cash is lent to insured and the life insurance is transferred to a holder<\/p>\n<p>If insured pays interest- maintains ability to claim life insurance\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If the insured doesn&#8217;t pay interest- life insurance gets transferred to holder\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>If transferred to the holder, funder(s) wait until the insured is proven dead.<\/p>\n<p>Once dead the death benefit is paid out<\/p>\n<p>Holder sends death benefit to funders proportional to their share of capital provided.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>Smart Contracts<\/h1>\n<p><b>Funders<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Lock Capita<\/b>l into contract<\/p>\n<p><b>Unlock Capital<\/b> when holder receives death benefit, Insured Pays Back Loan or Total Capital Raised Not Accepted by Timeframe\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Notified<\/b> when capital unlocked\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Insured\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Lock life insurance<\/b> by transferring ownership to holder if capital is unlocked\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Unlock life insurance<\/b> by paying back loan or not getting above surrender value after a sale time period\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Unlock capital <\/b>by accepting the total capital locked by funders when sale time period ends and transferring life insurance<\/p>\n<p><b>Create insurance profile<\/b>&#8211; this insurance profile has Insurance details (such as issue class, type, carrier, death benefit, the total amount paid, surrender value and premium amount) and health details (such as age, gender, if a smoker, etc.)<\/p>\n<p>Set time period of the sale\/ borrowing capital of life insurance on the market\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Proof of life <\/b>complete each year\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Complete KYC <\/b>to create an insurance profile, a person needs to do KYC- if KYC is matched with a bad actor then the insurance profile is not able to be created.
